\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
We apply the Ames dataset (train.csv) to the quantlet "Data Preprocessing" to handle missings, outliers and dimensionality. 
There are 19 variables with missing values, from which 14 have a meaning according to the data description. 
\autoref{fig:mis} visualizes the missings for the remaining 5 variables. Especially for LotFrontage there are a lot of missing values, as well as YearGarage built. For the latter it is possible that this means there is no garage, however, unlike for the other variables where missingness has a meaning this would not be reported in the data description. Because we find it would be arbitrary to treat these missings differently then others, they are imputed like the others
The check for remaining missings returns a "false", thus the imputation was successfull. 
All numeric variables after preprocessing are then displayed in some histograms in \autoref{fig:hist}. Some of these variables only show few different values, however overall the distribution of the (scaled) variables appears to be suitable for further analysis (as independent variables). 
For the PCA, the screeplot displayed in \autoref{fig:scree} is indecisive, as there are two "elbows".  We therefore use the solution in between with 4 components, which explain about 70\% of the initial variance.  
\autoref{fig:box} shows some example variables which have the most outliers before and after truncation to the $3 \times IQR$. Visual inspection of the graphs confirms, that the general distribution is not altered, only the extreme values are now truncated.
