\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
The quantlet "Data Preprocessing" is now tested with the Ames dataset (train.csv) to account for missings, outliers and dimensionality. 
There are 19 variables with missing values, from which 14 have a meaning according to the data description. 
\autoref{fig:mis} visualizes the missings for the remaining 5 variables. Especially for LotFrontage there are a lot of missing values, as well as YearGarage built. For the latter it is possible that this means there is no garage, however, unlike for the other variables where missingness has a meaning this would not be reported in the data description. Because we find it would be arbitrary to treat these missings differently then others, they are imputed like the other variables.
The check for remaining missings returns a \textit{false}, thus the imputation was successfull. 
All numeric variables after preprocessing are then displayed in a matrix of  histograms in \autoref{fig:hist}. Some of these variables only show few different values, however overall the distribution of the (scaled) variables appears to be suitable for further analysis (as independent variables). 
\autoref{fig:box} shows some example variables which have the most outliers before and after truncation to the $3 \times IQR$. Visual inspection of the graphs confirms, that the general distribution is not altered, only the extreme values are now truncated. 


Based on the correlation 8 numeric variables are selected for the PCA. With regard to the number of components that should be extracted, the screeplot displayed in \autoref{fig:scree} is indecisive, as there are two "elbows".  We therefore use a solution in between with 4 components, which together explain about 70\% of the initial variance.
