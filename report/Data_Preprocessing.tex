After reading in the preprocessed data factor variables are transformed
into dummies. For this, a model matrix is created that contains all
factor levels as columns. Now for each row a 1 is given, if a case
has a certain value in a factor, 0 otherwise. Then, numeric variables
are standardized and combined with the dummy variables. To avoid issues
with spaces, the names of the variables are converted so they can
be handled by R.
