\subsection{Random Forest}
A Random Forest Regression model is an ensemble of Regression Trees. Therefore in this section we will first explain the way in which a single Regression Tree works and afterwards we will illustrate the method of creating an ensemble method and explain how this applies to the Random Forest.
\subsubsection{Regression Trees}
Just as its close relative the Classification Tree the Regression Tree is based on the principle of recursive transition. This method divides the dataset into separate subsets based on a series of binary tests. In the graphical representation of a tree each of these tests is represented by a node. Based on whether the test returns \textit{True} or \textit{False} for a given observation this observation follows down one of the two edges going out of the node until it ends in one of the so called \textit{Leafnodes} at the bottom of the tree.s
