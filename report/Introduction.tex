In the course of this project we predict the sale prices of houses using a number of different regression and machine learning algorithms. As a data source we choose the data from the Kaggle Competition \textit{House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques} that is currently running. This data contains final sale prices of houses in the city of Ames, Iowa as well as a large number of different explanatory variables for each property. Our overall aim is to evaluate the different algorithms against each other rather than optimizing the predictions of one single model. For this we train different types of regression models as well as a random forest and a gradient boosting machine on a subset of the data and test the predictive power of these models on the remaining data. The project is based entirely on the statistical programming language \textit{R}, where we rely on different packages, but also implement some modelling aspects ourselves. The paper is structured in the following way: First we give a theoretical overview over each of the models that we use, explaining the main ideas and mathematical theory behind them. Afterwards we describe how we use \textit{R} to  analyse and pre-process the data as well as implement, train and tune the different models. In the fourth section the empirical results of our analysis are presented. We complete the study by summarising our findings and conclusions. 


The implementation in \textit{R} is divided in the following six QuantLets:
